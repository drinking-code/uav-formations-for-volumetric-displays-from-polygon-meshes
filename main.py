"""
1. Load data / convert into standardised format
2. Find hard edges & corners
    - sharpness of corners calculated by taking sum of the angles between all adjacent edges that connect to the vertex.
      deviation of this sum from 360Â° is the sharpness -> normalised with 0 - 360 => 1 - 0 and 360 - 720 => 0 - 1
3. Reduce hard corners that are too close
4. Distribute points on hard corners (vertices)
4. Distribute points on hard edges _while keeping distance to already generated points_
5. Distribute points on faces including soft edges and corners (vertices) (bluse noise sampling) _while keeping
   distance to already generated points_
6. Map colors to points
7. (Optional) perform checks
